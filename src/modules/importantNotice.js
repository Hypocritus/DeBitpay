  <p>DeBitpay should be used as a temporary solution - that's not how Bitcoin transactions supposed to work! Each time you extract data with DeBitpay and pay an invoice, please let the merchant know that you had to use DeBitpay in order to make the payment. Ask them to provide support for native Bitcoin transactions. And share your experience in social media, so that smart competitors could see a market opportunity in this issue. At the end, you should be able to make payments from your wallet to merchants directly, without DeBitpay.</p>
